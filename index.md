# About Me 
I am a doctoral candidate at Cornell's J.E.B. Brooks School of Public Policy concentrating in economics with a minor in data science. My research interests are broadly policy analysis, labor economics, and the economics of education. I employ a variety of methodological tools from econometrics to natural language processing and machine learning. I am currently spending the bulk of my time on two projects. The first is a national childcare provider dataset for which I am actively collecting historic and real-time childcare data (see more here). The second is an approvated restricted-access [Census](https://www.census.gov/topics/research/guidance/restricted-use-microdata.html) project examining the effects of minimum wage increases on childcare firms. 

In addition to my work in early childcare, I am also actively pursuing projects studying the 1) effect of magnet school entry on academic, racial, and socio-economic classroom segregation through an approved project with [Texas ERC data](https://texaserc.utexas.edu/), 2) effectiveness of school health programs in New York City through a partnership with the Office of School Health, and 3) effect of student's course taking behavior on their labor market outcomes through a partnership with [Burning Glass Institute](https://www.burningglassinstitute.org/) and University of Michigan's [College and Beyond II Initiative](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/about/cms/4370). 

If you are interested in Katharineâ€™s work and would like to know more, feel free to get in touch by email ks2373@cornell.edu.
