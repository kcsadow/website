# About Me 
My research interests are broadly policy analysis, labor and public economics, and the economics of education, especially Early Childhood Education. I employ a variety of methodological tools from econometrics to natural language processing and machine learning. I am an Assistant Professor at Stanford University in the Graduate School of Education.

I am currently spending the bulk of my time on two projects. The first is a national childcare provider dataset for which I am actively collecting historic and real-time childcare data (see more [here](https://kcsadow.github.io/website/dataviz/)). The second is an approved [restricted-access Census](https://www.census.gov/topics/research/guidance/restricted-use-microdata.html) project examining the effects of minimum wage increases on childcare firms. These projects were sponsored in part by the [Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy](https://www.horowitz-foundation.org/2024) and the [2024 W.E. Upjohn Institute/RSF Dissertation Grant Program](https://www.russellsage.org/news/third-annual-dissertation-research-grants-awarded). 

I am also actively pursuing projects studying 1) the effect of magnet school openings on academic, racial, and socio-economic classroom segregation through an approved project with the [Texas ERC](https://texaserc.utexas.edu/), 2) the effectiveness of school health programs in New York City through a partnership with the Office of School Health, and 3) the effect of student's course taking behavior on their labor market outcomes through a partnership with [Burning Glass Institute](https://www.burningglassinstitute.org/) and University of Michigan's [College and Beyond II Initiative](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/about/cms/4370). 

During my time as a PhD student, I also began working as an economist with the Burning Glass Institute where I examined labor market outcomes and the return on investment for higher education through partnerships with the [University of North Carolina system](https://www.northcarolina.edu/wp-content/uploads/reports-and-documents/economic-reports/unc-roi-study-of-university-programs-november-2023.pdf) and the [Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board](https://www.texas-air.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TAIR2024-D4_Aligning-Texas-Higher-Education-Supply-and-Labor-Market-Demand.pdf). 

I would be happy to discuss my work, applying to graduate school, the trade-off between MA and PhD programs, or my time working at BGI or studying at Cornell. Feel free to get in touch by email ks2373@cornell.edu.
