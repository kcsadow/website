# Katharine Sadowski, PhD Candidate 
## Cornell University, Brooks School of Public Policy 

# About Me 
I am a doctoral candidate at Cornell's Brook School of Public Policy concentrating in economics with a minor in data science. My research interests are broadly policy analysis, labor economics, and the economics of education. I am currently spending the bulk of my time on two projects. The first is a national childcare provider dataset for which I am actively collecting historic and real-time childcare data. The second is a restricted-access Census project examining the effects of minimum wage increases on childcare firms. In addition to my work in early childcare, I am also actively pursuing a variety of projects studying the effectiveness of school health programs in NYC, the effect of online learning on transfer student outcomes, and the effect of student's course taking behavior on student's labor market outcomes. 

I employ a variety of methodological tools from econometrics to natural language processing and machine learning. I enjoy learning new programming languages and packages, not only because they are a fun challenge, but also because I believe they are an essential stepping stone to creating research informed policy solutions.
