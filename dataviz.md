[Professional Development Website](https://kcsadow.shinyapps.io/agile_lab/) (using R Shiny App)

Harvard's Agile Teacher Lab conducted a Teaching Practices Survey for teachers taking a special professional development course. This website allows teachers who are participating in the course to 1) compare their personalized survey results (emailed to them individually) to aggregate results for comparison cohorts of teachers and 2) find grade and subject relevant-resources for areas of instruction they would like to improve.

**Childcare Desert Map** 

This map is the product of a two year long effort to contact every state agency with childcare licensing data in the United States to collect a comprehensive list of every childcare provider and relevant business information including their address, sector (Head Start, Family Day Home, Childcare, Pre-K), capacity, ages of children served, among other information. This is an active collection, with currently 35 states reporting. As part of this project, I am also actively working on scraping state websites on a monthly basis. This July will mark 1 year of monthly data retrieval. Once cleaned, these resources will provide researchers a real-time, publicly available, source of childcare providers and capacity.
