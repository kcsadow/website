**Childcare Desert Map** 

This map is the product of a two year long effort to contact every state agency with childcare licensing data in the United States to collect a comprehensive list of every childcare provider and relevant business information including their address, sector (Head Start, Family Day Home, Childcare, Pre-K), capacity, ages of children served, among other information. This is an active collection, with currently 35 states reporting. As part of this project, I am also actively working on scraping state websites on a monthly basis. This July will mark 1 year of monthly data retrieval. Once cleaned, these resources will provide researchers a real-time, publicly available, source of childcare providers and capacity.
