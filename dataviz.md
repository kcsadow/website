[Professional Development Website] (https://kcsadow.shinyapps.io/agile_lab/) (using R Shiny App)
Harvard's Agile Teacher Lab conducted a Teaching Practices Survey for teachers taking a special professional development course. This website allows teachers who are participating in the course to 1) compare their personalized survey results (emailed to them individually) to aggregate results for comparison cohorts of teachers and 2) find grade and subject relevant-resources for areas of instruction they would like to improve.

Heatmap of teacher language (using Python)
Harvard's Agile Teacher Lab conducted virtual reality teacher simulations where teachers interacted with students (voiced by actors) to practice agile teaching practice. Teachers led students through a prompt and were graded on the level of feedback each of each of their responses. This visual allows you to compare linguistic differences (e.g., unigrams and bigrams) between low, medium, and high-level teacher feedback statements.
