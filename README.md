## About Me

I am a current doctoral student in Policy Analysis and Management at Cornell University where I am concentrating in economics with a minor in data science. I am passionate about ensuring all students have access to a high-quality education. Being aware of the equity gaps that exist across the United States, I have started working on projects that examine how to improve teacher quality throguh teacher trainings and evaluating the equity of online versus in-person college programs. 

In order to answer these difficult questions, I employ a variety of methodological tools from econometrics to natural language processing and machine learning. I love learning new programming languages and packages, not only because they are a fun challenge, but also because I believe they are an essential stepping stone to creating research informed policy solutions.
