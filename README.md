## About Me

I am a current doctoral candidate at Cornell University's Brook School of Public Policy where I am concentrating in economics with a minor in data science. I am passionate about ensuring all children have access to high-quality education regardless of their socio-economic backgrounds. My work is focused broadly in the fields of policy analysis, economics of education, and labor economics. I have two active projects examining 1) the effects of minimum wage policies on childcare business dynamics and 2) how access to high school magnet and career/technical programs affects student short term and long term outcomes. 

In order to answer these questions, I employ a variety of methodological tools from econometrics to natural language processing and machine learning. I love learning new programming languages and packages, not only because they are a fun challenge, but also because I believe they are an essential stepping stone to conducting rigorous research which is necessary to inform policy.
