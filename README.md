## About Me

I received my PhD from Cornell University's Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy in May 2025. My degree is in public policy with concentrations in economics and data science. I am an empirical microeconomist focused broadly in the fields of policy analysis, economics of education, early childhood education, and labor/public economics. I employ a variety of methodological tools including econometrics, natural language processing, and machine learning. I have mutiple strains of research with the majority of my time currently dedicated to my Job Market Paper, in which I examine the effects of minimum wage policies on childcare businesses. I'll be joining Stanford University's Graduate School of Education as an Assistant Professor of Education September 2025.
