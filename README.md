## About Me

I am a doctoral candidate at Cornell University's Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy where I am concentrating in economics with a minor in data science. I am an empirical microeconomist focused broadly in the fields of policy analysis, economics of education, early childhood education, and labor/public economics. I employ a variety of methodological tools including econometrics, natural language processing, and machine learning. I have mutiple active strains of personal research with the majority of my energy currently dedicated to my Job Market Paper examining the effects of minimum wage policies on childcare businesses. In fall 2025, I'll be joining the Stanford Graduate School of Education as an Assistant Professor.
